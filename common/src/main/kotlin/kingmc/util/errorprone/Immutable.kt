/**
 * The class to which this annotation is applied is immutable.
 *
 *
 * An object is immutable if its state cannot be observed to change after construction. Immutable
 * objects are inherently thread-safe.
 *
 *
 * A class is immutable if all instances of that class are immutable. The immutability of a class
 * can only be fully guaranteed if the class is final, otherwise one must ensure all subclasses are
 * also immutable.
 *
 *
 * A conservative definition of object immutability is:
 *
 *
 *  * All fields are final;
 *  * All reference fields are of immutable type, or null;
 *  * It is *properly constructed* (the `this` reference does not escape the
 * constructor).
 *
 *
 *
 * The requirement that all reference fields be immutable ensures *deep* immutability,
 * meaning all contained state is also immutable. A weaker property, common with container classes,
 * is *shallow* immutability, which allows some of the object's fields to point to mutable
 * objects. One example of shallow immutability is guava's ImmutableList, which may contain mutable
 * elements.
 *
 *
 * It is possible to implement immutable classes with some internal mutable state, as long as
 * callers can never observe changes to that state. For example, some state may be lazily
 * initialized to improve performance.
 *
 *
 * It is also technically possible to have an immutable object with non-final fields (see the
 * implementation of [String.hashCode] for an example), but doing this correctly requires
 * subtle reasoning about safe data races and deep knowledge of the Java Memory Model.
 *
 *
 * Use of this annotation is validated by [Error Prone's immutability analysis](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/Immutable),
 * which ensures that all `@Immutable`-annotated classes are deeply immutable according to the
 * conservative definition above. Non-final classes may be annotated with `@Immutable`, and
 * any code compiled by Error Prone will be checked to ensure that no mutable subtypes of
 * `@Immutable`-annotated classes exist.
 *
