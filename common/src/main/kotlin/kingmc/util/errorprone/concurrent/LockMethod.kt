/**
 * The method to which this annotation is applied acquires one or more locks. The caller will hold
 * the locks when the function finishes execution.
 *
 *
 * This annotation does not apply to built-in (synchronization) locks, which cannot be acquired
 * without being released in the same method.
 *
 *
 * The arguments determine which locks the annotated method acquires:
 *
 *
 *  * `field-name`: The lock is referenced by the final instance field specified by
 * *field-name*.
 *  * `class-name.this.field-name`: For inner classes, it may be necessary to
 * disambiguate 'this'; the *class-name.this* designation allows you to specify which
 * 'this' reference is intended.
 *  * `class-name.field-name`: The lock is referenced by the static final field
 * specified by *class-name.field-name*.
 *  * `method-name()`: The lock object is returned by calling the named nullary
 * method.
 *
